# Brooklyn-Central Catalog Javascript Site

This is the GUI for the community catalog, based on twitter Bootstrap and Angular. It uses few different tools to build
the app:

 * **npm** to handle package dependencies
 * **bower** to handle web dependencies
 * **gulp** to build the app

The generated app will then be packaged as a web fragment with **maven**.

## Development

To run the app, you need first to launch the REST server. [Please refer to the documentation](../rest-server/README.md).

Once the server is started, you need to install, build and launch the embedded web server:

    ~# cd /path/to/client
    ~# npm install
    ~# gulp build --serve
   
## Build command

The `gulp build` command has three flags that you can use:

 * `--production` will generate the minified and uglified version of the javascript and CSS files and automatically use them. If the parameter is missing, the app will only use the concatenate version that embeds the sourcemap.
 * `--serve` will launch and serve the app at `http://localhost:8000/`
 * `--watch` will watch for any changes within the source file and launch appropriate tasks.

The app file are copied and generated into `target/app`

## Build a jar

The maven module is setup to use the app generated by `gulp`. You only thing you need to build the web fragment jar is
to run the following command:

    mvn clean install

## How to run the GUI + REST server

You will need to compile, build and run the dist module. [Please refer to the documentation](../dist/README.md)
